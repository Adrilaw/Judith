I loved Hope once.
She held my heart, only to break it.
Yet, I still believed—still chased the echo of what we were,
blind to the truth that some things aren’t meant to be.

Then came Judith—
steady, kind, willing to love me
while I was lost in the ruins of the past.
She was real, but I was blind.
Still hoping for Hope.

Hope played with me again, and I let her.
In doing so, I let go of Judith.
But when the illusion of Hope finally faded,
and I turned back to where love once stood,
Judith was still there—
loving me, but holding someone else’s hand.

She had principles.
And I had regret.

Because sometimes, Hope isn’t what saves us—
it’s what makes us lose what truly mattered all along.
